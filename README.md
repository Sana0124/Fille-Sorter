# File-Sorter
#### This is a simple day-to-day project that helps you sort files into specific folders.

#### We often deal with a large number of files and folders, and it’s easy to forget to organize them properly. As a student, I frequently encounter this issue while tailoring my resume for different roles. But this isn’t just a student problem—anyone can struggle with file organization.
To solve this, I came up with a cool solution that automatically sorts files into the correct folders, eliminating the need to manually create folders and drag and drop files. Sure, you could drag and drop manually, but when dealing with multiple files, that process gets tedious and time-consuming. Why not write a few lines of code instead? It's not even a full paragraph of code, but it can save you tons of effort, leaving your folders organized in no time!

##### I created this as a fun experiment using Python, where I sorted my resumes into specific folders, and it’s pretty cool to see how easily you can incorporate it into your daily routine.
